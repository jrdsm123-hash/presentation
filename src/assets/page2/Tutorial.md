The second step is to start setting up the server.Since it was required for the course, we chose the cheaper usage plan.

And select CentOSf for this experiment

Next, configure the network.Use Huawei Cloud's default IP address

The server name uses its default eCS-E996.Then set a password.
![password]（src\assets\page2\images\password.png）
The following settings are all default and will not be explained in detail. Finally, the server is created successfully and starts running.

Use Xshell to remotely connect to the server via SSH.
